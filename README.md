The animations generated by the script hat4d.wls are in the output folder. If you would like to run the script by yourself, you need to go through the following steps.

- Install wolframscript
- Install POV ray http://www.povray.org/
- Install this package: https://github.com/xslittlegrass/POVRayRender-For-Mathematica See the "installation" step in the readme file.
- In my script, I have ConfigurePOVRayRender["POVRayPath" -> "C:\\\\Program Files\\\\POV-Ray\\\\v3.7\\\\bin\\\\pvengine64.exe"];
This is because my POV-ray is installed in this path on my PC. If you install POV ray at a different path, please update this line.
- Install ImageMagick: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php and add it to your path. You should be able to use magick convert .... in your commandline.
- Install ffmpeg https://ffmpeg.org/ and add it to your path. You should be able to use ffmpeg in your commandline.
- At this point, if you run wolframscript.exe hat4d.wls, it should compute the coordinates, and launch POV ray to render images and save to the disk. Then ImageMagick should do some image cropping, and ffmpeg will make GIF and MP4 out of the images.
- Some config variables such as the projection method are defined in the beginning of hat4d.wls. You can change them to generate different images and animations.
- For less human intervention, you can configure POV ray so that it will automatically quit after rendering each image. I also disable the sound after completing an image.

I'm using Windows. If you are using another OS, I think the steps should theoretically work. But you may have to adjust some.
